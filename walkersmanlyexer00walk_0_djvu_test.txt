IMPOETANCE OE PHYSICAL EXERCISES. 

Education may be divided into two parts, physical and 
mental. Of the former, Exercises or Gymnastics are the 
most extensive and the earliest portion. 

Their extent is learnt by an enumeration of them, viz.. 
Walking, Running, Leaping, Vaulting, Pole-leaping, Balancing, 
Skating, Carrying, Climbing, and Swimming. We have added 
Throwing the Discus; and, in a coui'se of British Exercises, 
we think Ro\^ing, Sailing, Riding, and Driving, would be very 
improperly omitted.
